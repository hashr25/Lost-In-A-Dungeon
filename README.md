# Lost-In-A-Dungeon

This project was a research project I while in my Data Structures class in undergraduate. The mini-game is an exploration on procedural content generation, specifically procedural map generation. 
All game features developed in Unity Game Engine with scripting in C#.

A playable demo is now available on my online portfolio...
